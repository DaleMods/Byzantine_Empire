The Byzantine Empire, often called the Eastern Roman Empire or simply Byzantium, existed from 330 to 1453 CE. With its capital founded at Constantinople by Constantine I (r. 306-337 CE), the Empire varied in size over the centuries, at one time or another, possessing territories located in Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Levant, Asia Minor, and North Africa. A Christian state with Greek as the official language, the Byzantines developed their own political systems, religious practices, art and architecture, which, although significantly influenced by the Greco-Roman cultural tradition, were distinct and not merely a continuation of ancient Rome. The Byzantine Empire was the longest-lasting medieval power, and its influence continues today, especially in the religion, art, architecture, and law of many Western states, Eastern and Central Europe, and Russia.

The beginnings of the Byzantine Empire lie in the decision of Roman emperor Constantine I to relocate the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Byzantium on 11 May 330 CE. The popular name Constantinople or ‘City of Constantine’ soon replaced the emperor’s own official choice of ‘New Rome’. The new capital had an excellent natural harbour on the Golden Horn inlet and, straddled on the border between Europe and Asia, could control the passage of ships through the Bosphorus from the Aegean to the Black Sea, linking lucrative trade between west and east. A great chain stretched across the Golden Horn’s entrance, and the construction of the massive Theodosian Walls between 410 and 413 CE meant that the city was able to withstand time and again concerted attacks from both sea and land. Over the centuries, as more spectacular buildings were added, the cosmopolitan city became one of the finest of any epoch and certainly the richest, most lavish and most important Christian city in the world.

About the Mod:
--------------

Play as Constantine leading the Byzantine Empire. Constantine I the Great was the Roman Emperor who rebuilt the city of Byzantium in the Roman Eastern Empire and named it Constantinople in 330AD. His dynasty ruled over the Roman Eastern Empire until the fall of Rome in 476AD, and from then the Empire was regarded as first "New Rome" and then later Byzantine Empire after the ancient city name. Being a mix of both Roman and Greek cultures Byzantine rose to be the most powerful Empire in the World at the end of the 6th Century, but continuous wars with its neighbors, and rising powers in Persia, Arabia and Western Europe eventually led to the end of the Empire in 1453 when the Ottomans captured Constantinople.
